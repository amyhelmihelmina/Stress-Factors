# Factors Influencing Stress

## Summary
This project used Python and its libraries to explore several factors that may/not influence stress.

## Questions

1. Identify the most direct cause(s) of stress.
2. Is there any particular demographics that are more prone to developing stress?
3. Does family history influence stress development?
4. Do living circumstances directly cause stress?

## Methodology

1. Data cleaning: load dataset into notebook, check for data types, any null values, and data shape
2. Data transformation: standardise column names, convert timestamp into datetime
3. Data analysis and visualisation: use matplotlib and seaborn to visualise relationship and trends between variables

## Skills

Python: numpy, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn

## Results and findings

### Direct cause of stress
The datset did not suggest one factor being more responsible for causing stress than another. It seems that stress is subjective and dependent on every individual. However, the following findings can still offer useful insights for policymaking:

### Vulnerable demographics
Individuals working in corporate have the highest rate of stress:

### Family history
Having family history does not contribute to growing stress:

### Living circumstances

## Next Steps

1. Work with relevant departments to identify target group for mental health services.
2. Improve data collection to even out discrepancy based on sex.
